## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please open an issue with "Vulnerability" in the title. This project is currently only intended to be run manually on a local machine and for the duration of a stream.
If you do come across something that could leave the local machine vulnerable please be sure to report it via GitHub issues as mentioned. This is a side project that I work on intermittently 
but I will do my best to respond more promptly for such issues. If a vulnerability is reported I will take some time to evaluate things further and provide a response on further actions that will be takend upon completion.
