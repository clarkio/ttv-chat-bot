Reorganizing as of 11/22/2019:

✔ Figure out the bug for the overlay getting stuck on a color after an alert is triggered @done(Sat 01/11/2020 - 05:07 PM)
✔ remove hard-coded strings to be constants (when appropriate) @created(Sat 12/14/2019 - 12:49 AM) @done(19-12-14 00:49)
- play any sound files via the browser sources instead of via node.js directly
  - steal code from the michael jolley for handling this (hahahahaha)
- instead of having code handle parsing the commands and having to know all the chat commands let's leverage the trained AI to determine if a message is a command and parse the arguments out of the message for us
- speech to text
- game idea (yet to be revealed on stream): viewers send commands in chat to participate in a game. if chat wins and solves the game then that triggers something to happen to clarkio otherwise.
- Maybe refactor to this: [13:26] nallaj: @Clarkio why not use TS enums for this?
- Refactor Manager file names: [13:27] roberttables: @Clarkio You know MPJ will harp on you for using "manager" in your names Kappa
- Add tests (Kappa): [13:29] roberttables: Wait, do we have tests for this code @Clarkio ??



Big Bright Future Plans 11/22/2019:

*** Make the bot more platform agnostic ***
- Something that will actively listen for channel events in a stream.
  Figure out all the alerts/events per platform to see where there are overlaps that can be included in a core package
    - Twitch: Follows, Subscriptions (Gifted Subs, Prime Subs), Cheers (Bits), Raid/Host, Join Chat, Part Chat
    - Mixer: Follows, Subscriptsion, Embers, Sparks
    - YouTube:
    - Facebook:


Old Todo:
  ☐ Add code to limit permissions for !scene commands @created(19-03-22 20:27)
  ☐ Determine a way to automatically stop any scene effects that correspond to this sound effect when the sound effect is done
  Problem: Audio file is long and the effect is overplayed
      Solution: stop audio on command
  Problem: When a soundfx is triggered and there is a corresponding scene effect it needs to stop when the soundfx is stopped
  ☐ Draw/write out the flow of effects @created(19-03-08 00:30)
     - This is to better manage the different types of effects and what actions to take since things are getting a bit unwieldy (light, overlay, sound, etc.)
  - Effects Manager is to be the main brain of the project
      - It receives triggers from Alerts Manager and Chat Manager
      - It will determine if the alert or chat trigger maps to a supported command and therefore has some associated effect to apply
      - Once an effect is found to be applied the effects manager will handle starting all the various effects that go with it (such as sound, light, scene, overlay)

!bulb <color> (!bulb blue)
!bulb <effect> (e.g. !bulb cop mode)
!scene <scene name> (e.g. !scene cam)
!<sound> (!fart)
other text !<sound> more text
maybe !sfx <filename>?

1. Identify the command being used (parse chat for a command)
2. Get command definitions which describes command signatures (meaning its options)
  Example: !bulb blue or !bulb cop mode
  yargs, minimist
  {

  }
3. Apply input/data to command (execute the command using the input provide from the chat message)
