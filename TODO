Todo:
  ☐ Add code to limit permissions for !scene commands @created(19-03-22 20:27)
  ☐ Determine a way to automatically stop any scene effects that correspond to this sound effect when the sound effect is done
  Problem: Audio file is long and the effect is overplayed
      Solution: stop audio on command
  Problem: When a soundfx is triggered and there is a corresponding scene effect it needs to stop when the soundfx is stopped
  ☐ Draw/write out the flow of effects @created(19-03-08 00:30)
     - This is to better manage the different types of effects and what actions to take since things are getting a bit unwieldy (light, overlay, sound, etc.)
  - Effects Manager is to be the main brain of the project
      - It receives triggers from Alerts Manager and Chat Manager
      - It will determine if the alert or chat trigger maps to a supported command and therefore has some associated effect to apply
      - Once an effect is found to be applied the effects manager will handle starting all the various effects that go with it (such as sound, light, scene, overlay)
